title: Debian install records

## 1. debian failed to boot 181030
this afternoon the pc stops responding saying

BERT cant request iomem region /dev/sda1


it is mostly associated with fstab, try to disable some partitions and the system may get back to work.
run below when folder is not mounted

```
e2fsck -vf /dev/sdb

```

it will show many errors, and the errors may be related to bad blocks in the hard disk partition

other things i have tried
a. reinstall mbr
grub-install /dev/sda
b. re-configur grub
grub-config -i /root/grub/grub.cfg
grub-update

but i do not think these are the reasons

## 2. use normal lan cable to connect laptop with rpi


## 3. install for a debian

```bash
apt install ipython dh-autoreconf tmux git gcc build-essential gfortran
apt install libx11-dev libssl-dev libssl1.0-dev  # for rdesktop

fzf

apt install python-matplotlib python-pandas python-pip python-requests

```
